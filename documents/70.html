Some years ago—never mind how long<br/>precisely—having little or no money in my purse, and nothing<br/>particular to interest me on shore, I thought I would sail about<br/>a little and see the watery part of the world. It is a way I have<br/>of driving off the spleen, and regulating the circulation. When-<br/>ever I find myself growing grim about the mouth; whenever it<br/>is a damp, drizzly November in my soul; whenever I find myself<br/>involuntarily pausing before coffin warehouses, and bringing up<br/>the rear of every funeral I meet; and especially whenever my<br/>hypos get such an upper hand of me, that it requires a strong<br/>moral principle to prevent me from deliberately stepping into<br/>the street, and methodically knocking people's hats off—then, I<br/>account it high time to get to sea as soon as I can. This is my<br/>substitute for pistol and ball. With a philosophical flourish<br/>Cato throws himself upon his sword; I quietly take to the<br/>ship. There is nothing surprising in this. If they but knew it,<br/>almost all men in their degree, some time or other, cherish very<br/>nearly the same feelings towards the ocean with me.<br/><br/>There now is your insular city of the Manhattoes, belted<br/>round by wharves as Indian isles by coral reefs—commerce sur-<br/>rounds it with her surf. Right and left, the streets take you<br/>waterward. Its extreme down-town is the battery, where that<br/>noble mole is washed by waves, and cooled by breezes, which<br/>a few hours previous were out of sight of land. Look at the<br/>crowds of water-gazers there.<br/><br/>Circumambulate the city of a dreamy Sabbath afternoon.<br/>Go from Corlears Hook to Coenties Slip, and from thence, by<br/></span><span data-annotation-id='2956' class='annotation humedit-pb'>Whitehall, northward. What do you see?—Posted like silent<br/>sentinels all around the town, stand thousands upon thousands<br/>of mortal men fixed in ocean reveries. Some leaning against the<br/>spiles; some seated upon the pier-heads; some looking over the<br/>bulwarks of ships from China; some high aloft in the rigging,<br/>as if striving to get a still better seaward peep. But these are<br/>all landsmen; of week days pent up in lath and plaster—tied<br/>to counters, nailed to benches, clinched to desks. How then<br/>is this? Are the green fields gone? What do they here?<br/><br/>But look! here come more crowds, pacing straight<br/>for the water, and seemingly bound for a dive. Strange! Nothing<br/>will content them but the extremest limit of the land; loitering<br/>under the shady lee of yonder warehouses will not suffice. No.<br/>They must get just as nigh the water as they possibly can<br/>without falling in. And there they stand—miles of them—<br/>leagues. Inlanders all, they come from lanes and alleys, streets<br/>and avenues—north, east, south, and west. Yet here they all<br/>unite. Tell me, does the magnetic virtue of the needles of the<br/>compasses of all those ships attract them thither?<br/><br/>Once more. Say, you are in the country; in some high<br/>land of lakes. Take almost any path you please, and ten to one<br/>it carries you down in a dale, and leaves you there by a pool in<br/>the stream. There is magic in it. Let the most absent-minded<br/>of men be plunged in his deepest reveries—stand that man on<br/>his legs, set his feet a-going, and he will infallibly lead you to<br/>water, if water there be in all that region. Should you ever be<br/>athirst in the great American desert, try this experiment, if your<br/>caravan happen to be supplied with a metaphysical professor.<br/>Yes, as every one knows, meditation and water are wedded for<br/>ever.<br/><br/>But here is an artist. He desires to paint you the dream-<br/>iest, shadiest, quietest, most enchanting bit of romantic land-<br/>scape in all the valley of the Saco. What is the chief element<br/>he employs? There stand his trees, each with a hollow trunk,<br/></span><span data-annotation-id='2957' class='annotation humedit-pb'>as if a hermit and a crucifix were within; and here sleeps his<br/>meadow, and there sleep his cattle; and up from yonder cottage<br/>goes a sleepy smoke. Deep into distant woodlands winds a<br/>mazy way, reaching to overlapping spurs of mountains bathed<br/>in their hill-side blue. But though the picture lies thus<br/>tranced, and though this pine-tree shakes down its sighs like<br/>leaves upon this shepherd's head, yet all were vain, unless the<br/>shepherd's eye were fixed upon the magic stream before him.<br/>Go visit the Prairies in June, when for scores on scores of<br/>miles you wade knee-deep among Tiger-lilies—what is the<br/>one charm wanting?—Water—there is not a drop of water<br/>there! Were Niagara but a cataract of sand, would you<br/>travel your thousand miles to see it? Why did the poor poet<br/>of Tennessee, upon suddenly receiving two handfuls of silver,<br/>deliberate whether to buy him a coat, which he sadly<br/>needed, or invest his money in a pedestrian trip to Rockaway<br/>Beach? Why is almost every robust healthy boy with a<br/>robust healthy soul in him, at some time or other crazy to go<br/>to sea? Why upon your first voyage as a passenger, did you<br/>yourself feel such a mystical vibration, when first told that you<br/>and your ship were now out of sight of land? Why did the,<br/>old Persians hold the sea holy? Why did the Greeks give it<br/>a separate deity, and own brother of Jove? Surely all this is<br/>not without meaning. And still deeper the meaning of that<br/>story of Narcissus, who because he could not grasp the torment-<br/>ing, mild image he saw in the fountain, plunged into it and<br/>was drowned. But that same image, we ourselves see in all rivers<br/>and oceans. It is the image of the ungraspable phantom of<br/>life; and this is the key to it all.<br/><br/>Now, when I say that I am in the habit of going to sea<br/>whenever I begin to grow hazy about the eyes, and begin to be<br/>over conscious of my lungs, I do not mean to have it inferred<br/>that I ever go to sea as a passenger. For to go as a passenger<br/>you must needs have a purse, and a purse is but a rag unless<br/></span><span data-annotation-id='2958' class='annotation humedit-pb'>you have something in it. Besides, passengers get sea-sick—<br/>grow quarrelsome—don't sleep of nights—do not enjoy them-<br/>selves much, as a general thing;—no, I never go as a passen-<br/>ger; nor, though I am something of a salt, do I ever<br/>go to sea as a Commodore, or a Captain, or a Cook. I aban-<br/>don the glory and distinction of such offices to those who like<br/>them. For my part, I abominate all honorable respectable<br/>toils, trials, and tribulations of every kind whatsoever. It is<br/>quite as much as I can do to take care of myself, without<br/>taking care of ships, barques, brigs, schooners, and what not.<br/>And as for going as cook,—though I confess there is considerable<br/>glory in that, a cook being a sort of officer on ship-board—<br/>yet, somehow, I never fancied broiling fowls;—though once<br/>broiled, judiciously buttered, and judgmatically salted and<br/>peppered, there is no one who will speak more respectfully, not<br/>to say reverentially, of a broiled fowl than I will. It is out of<br/>the idolatrous dotings of the old Egyptians upon broiled ibis<br/>and roasted river horse, that you see the mummies of those<br/>creatures in their huge bake-houses the pyramids.<br/><br/>No, when I go to sea, I go as a simple sailor, right before<br/>the mast, plumb down into the forecastle, aloft there<br/>to the royal mast-head. True, they rather order me about some, and<br/>make me jump from spar to spar, like a grasshopper in a<br/>May meadow. And at first, this sort of thing is unpleasant<br/>enough. It touches one's sense of honor, particularly if you<br/>come of an old established family in the land, the Van Rensse-<br/>laers, or Randolphs, or Hardicanutes. And more than all,<br/>if just previous to putting your hand into the tar-pot, you have<br/>been lording it as a country schoolmaster, making the tallest<br/>boys stand in awe of you. The transition is a keen one, I<br/>assure you, from a schoolmaster to a sailor, and requires a strong<br/>decoction of Seneca and the Stoics to enable you to grin and<br/>bear it. But even this wears off in time.<br/><br/>What of it, if some old hunks of a sea-captain orders me to<br/></span><span data-annotation-id='2959' class='annotation humedit-pb'>get a broom and sweep down the decks? What does that<br/>indignity amount to, weighed, I mean, in the scales of the New<br/>Testament? Do you think the archangel Gabriel thinks any-<br/>thing the less of me, because I promptly and respectfully obey<br/>that old hunks in that particular instance? Who aint a slave?<br/>Tell me that. Well, then, however the old sea-captains may<br/>order me about—however they may thump and punch me<br/>about, I have the satisfaction of knowing that it is all right;<br/>that everybody else is one way or other served in much the<br/>same way—either in a physical or metaphysical point of view,<br/>that is; and so the universal thump is passed round, and all<br/>hands should rub each other's shoulder-blades, and be con-<br/>tent.<br/><br/>Again, I always go to sea as a sailor, because they make<br/>a point of paying me for my trouble, whereas they never pay<br/>passengers a single penny that I ever heard of. On the con-<br/>trary, passengers themselves must pay. And there is all the<br/>difference in the world between paying and being paid. The<br/>act of paying is perhaps the most uncomfortable infliction that<br/>the two orchard thieves entailed upon us. But being paid,<br/>—what will compare with it? The urbane activity with which a<br/>man receives money is really marvellous, considering that we so<br/>earnestly believe money to be the root of all earthly ills, and<br/>that on no account can a monied man enter heaven. Ah! how<br/>cheerfully we consign ourselves to perdition!<br/><br/>Finally, I always go to sea as a sailor, because of the whole-<br/>some exercise and pure air of the forecastle deck. For as<br/>in this world, head winds are far more prevalent than winds from<br/>astern (that is, if you never violate the Pythagorean maxim), so<br/>for the most part the Commodore on the quarter-deck gets his<br/>atmosphere at second hand from the sailors on the forecastle.<br/>He thinks he breathes it first; but not so. In much the same<br/>way do the commonalty lead their leaders in many other<br/>things, at the same time that the leaders little suspect it. But<br/></span><span data-annotation-id='2960' class='annotation humedit-pb'>wherefore it was that after having repeatedly smelt the sea as a<br/>merchant sailor, I should now take it into my head to go on a<br/>whaling voyage; this the invisible police officer of the Fates, who<br/>has the constant surveillance of me, and secretly dogs me, and<br/>influences me in some unaccountable way—he can better answer<br/>than any one else. And, doubtless, my going on this whaling<br/>voyage, formed part of the grand programme of Providence that<br/>was drawn up a long time ago. It came in as a sort of brief<br/>interlude and solo between more extensive performances. I take<br/>it that this part of the bill must have run something like this:<br/><br/>“ Grand Contested Election for the Presidency of the United States.<br/>“WHALING VOYAGE BY ONE ISHMAEL.<br/>“BLOODY BATTLE IN AFFGHANISTAN.”<br/><br/>Though I cannot tell why it was exactly that those stage<br/>managers, the Fates, put me down for this shabby part of a<br/>whaling voyage, when others were set down for magnificent<br/>parts in high tragedies, and short and easy parts in genteel<br/>comedies, and jolly parts in farces—though I cannot tell why<br/>this was exactly; yet, now that I recall all the circumstances, I<br/>think I can see a little into the springs and motives which being<br/>cunningly presented to me under various disguises, induced me<br/>to set about performing the part I did, besides cajoling me into<br/>the delusion that it was a choice resulting from my own unbiased<br/>freewill and discriminating judgment.<br/><br/>Chief among these motives was the overwhelming idea of the<br/>great whale himself. Such a portentous and mysterious monster<br/>roused all my curiosity. Then the wild and distant seas where<br/>he rolled his island bulk; the undeliverable, nameless perils of<br/>the whale; these, with all the attending marvels of a thousand<br/>Patagonian sights and sounds, helped to sway me to my wish.<br/>With other men, perhaps, such things would not have been<br/>inducements; but as for me, I am tormented with an everlas-<br/>ting itch for things remote. I love to sail forbidden seas, and<br/></span><span data-annotation-id='2961' class='annotation humedit-pb'>land on barbarous coasts. Not ignoring what is good, I am<br/>quick to perceive a horror, and could still be social with it<br/>—would they let me—since it is but well to be on friendly<br/>terms with all the inmates of the place one lodges in.<br/><br/>By reason of these things, then, the whaling voyage was wel-<br/>come; the great flood-gates of the wonder-world swung open,<br/>and in the wild conceits that swayed me to my purpose, two<br/>and two there floated into my inmost soul, endless processions<br/>of the whale, and, mid most of them all, one grand hooded phan-<br/>tom, like a snow hill in the air.<br/><br/><br/></span></div>
